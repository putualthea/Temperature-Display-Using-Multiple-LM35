# Temperature-Display-Using-Multiple-LM35-
This is a simple Arduino project simulation that I've tried on Proteus 8.6 before. This code contains a simple display of 5 LM35 temperature sensors on LCD 16x4, the minimum and maximum temperature from whole sensors, and running text of the minimum and maximum display .
